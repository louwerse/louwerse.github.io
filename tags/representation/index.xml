      <description>This project is collaborative work with Prof Thomas Zittel (Goethe Universit√§t Frankfurt am Main) and Prof Rosie Campbell (King&amp;rsquo;s College London). It is financially supported by DFG, ESRC, and NWO under the Open Research Area (ORA). The project will start in Spring 2019.
