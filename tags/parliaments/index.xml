      <description>&lt;p&gt;The digital publication of parliamentary data has provided a great incentive for the study of parliamentary behaviour. My current work focuses on the Netherlands and Belgium; in the coming years I intend to broaden the comparative scope of my studies. The main questions that I focus on are those of patterns of parliamentary (voting) behaviour, particularly with regard to party unity and the government-opposition division in parliament. In addition, I am interested in the concept of (positive and negative) parliamentarism as well as the government formation process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The policy link between voters and politicians has been a central issue in politics for quite some time. My work focuses on the quality of this policy link: are representatives doing what people want?&lt;/p&gt;
