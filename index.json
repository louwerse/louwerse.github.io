The project starts in December 2019.   The main objectives of this project are to measure and explain government-opposition cooperation and to study its consequences for democratic legitimacy and vote choice. Choice is essential to democracy; in modern representative democracies that choice is provided by opposition and governing parties competing in elections. If the choice is to be meaningful, opposition parties have to be distinct from government parties. Previous studies have looked at parties’ distinctiveness in the electoral arena, but what happens in parliament has been overlooked.\nAmong scholars as well as the general public, there are increasing concerns regarding the distinctiveness of opposition and government parties in parliament. Scholars have argued that there is a process of opposition blurring in parliament, but the evidence is largely anecdotal and based on single-country studies. This project is the first to provide longitudinal indicators of parliamentary cooperation between government and opposition in four countries.\nThe analysis compares established parliamentary democracies with very different political systems: The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Denmark and Canada. Applying innovative content analysis methods to assess parties’ actual parliamentary behaviour and speeches, I will map patterns of parliamentary cooperation between 1945 and 2018. Explanations of those patterns will be based on quantitative data and elite interviews. The effect of government-opposition cooperation on democratic satisfaction, electoral turnout, and vote choice will be studied through analysis of survey material as well as multi-country conjoint survey experiments.\n","date":1569967200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569967200,"objectID":"54e1941841b00c6db3aac9224f8cee7f","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/project/who-opposes/","publishdate":"2019-10-02T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/who-opposes/","section":"project","summary":"The main objectives of this project are to measure and explain government-opposition cooperation and to study its consequences for democratic legitimacy and vote choice.","tags":["parliaments","representation"],"title":"Who opposes?","type":"project"},{"authors":["Simon Otjes","Tom Louwerse"],"categories":null,"content":"   ","date":1568160000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568160000,"objectID":"3f52c256478e6d371c005d9836569c01","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/publication/2019-otjes-louwerse-wilders-gewogen/","publishdate":"2019-09-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-otjes-louwerse-wilders-gewogen/","section":"publication","summary":"Bij de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van november 2006 wist de Partij voor de Vrijheid (PVV) als enige rechtse nieuwkomer zetels te behalen.

This article argues that portfolio design is a substantively and theoretically relevant phenomenon that has major implications for the study of institutional design and coalition politics. The authors use comparative data on portfolio design reforms in nine Western European countries since the 1970s to demonstrate how the design of government portfolios changes over time. Specifically, they show that portfolios are changed frequently (on average about once a year) and that such shifts are more likely after changes in the prime ministership or the party composition of the government. These findings suggest a political logic behind these reforms based on the preferences and power of political parties and politicians. They have major implications for the study of institutional design and coalition politics.","tags":null,"title":"The political dynamics of portfolio design in European democracies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom Louwerse","Simon Otjes"],"categories":null,"content":" This is an open access publication   ","date":1557878400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557878400,"objectID":"b1f334e5f9b5f97e0e0923b49eb65a3d","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/publication/2018-louwerse-otjes/","publishdate":"2019-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-louwerse-otjes/","section":"publication","summary":"This article analyses how populist parties wage opposition in parliament.

Over the past couple of months, we got the chance to get to know each other: a diverse group of scholars from all of our faculties, with very diverse academic backgrounds, nationally and internationally. Together, we get the unique chance to discover our disciplinary differences and commonalities, and to shape what the Young Academy Leiden is all about.\nToday we will present ourselves, our research and ambitions for the Young Academy Leiden and will also uncover our first major activity a little later in the programme. But first let me reflect on something that has been a key term in university policy and the conception of a Young Academy in Leiden: academic excellence.\nThe term academic excellence has become a buzzword in the academic world. But what does it mean? Sometimes the term excellence is used in an attempt to focus attention and resources on those researchers with unusually good qualities. This ‘super star model’ of science has recently met with criticism, however, from De Jonge Akademie, our big sister organisation at the national level. They argue that the widening gap between the haves and have-nots is not beneficial to a good academic climate. Funding opportunities are, after all, very much limited and many great young scholars with strong proposals cannot be funded. And this in turn leads to unequal chances for further funding and promotion.\nWe too have been selected as members of the Young Academy Leiden in part because of our academic record. But we don’t consider ourselves super stars. We view true academic excellence in different terms.\nFirst, an excellent university recognises that science is done together. We work together, we build on each other’s arguments. We stand on the shoulders of giants, but also on many normal shoulders of people who have contributed to development in their respective fields.\nSecond, an excellent university connects education and research and this requires research active staff across the board. An excellent university allows its students to excel.\nAnd thirdly, academic excellence asks us to look beyond our disciplines and to society. Our bastion of liberty should not be an ivory tower, but a sanctuary open to all and connected to the cities of Leiden and The Hague and the world.\nWe are humbled to get the chance to work on these objectives. To strengthen interdisciplinary exchange, to reach out to society and to reflect on university policy from the perspective of young researchers.\nWe recognize the help over the years of mentors, friends and colleagues. Speaking from my own perspective: sometimes the job of an academic can be very individual, working on your own projects and teaching your own courses. But far more often I receive support from colleagues in many different shapes. From supervisors and mentors, from people critically reflecting upon my work, from discussions at the lunch table about politics and the university. I am sure this is true for all members of the Young Academy Leiden. We are enormously thankful for the help and support given to us and the opportunity provided to be a part of the Young Academy Leiden. Therefore, we very much look forward to working in service of and together with everyone at our university and beyond.\nIt is now my great pleasure to present to you the first members of the Young Academy Leiden.\n  ","date":1553090400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553090400,"objectID":"6b9468a97baa3da45c155a30af9e1deb","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/talk/2019-03-20-inauguration-yal/","publishdate":"2019-03-20T16:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-03-20-inauguration-yal/","section":"talk","summary":"As the chair of Young Academy Leiden, I addressed the public at our inauguration.

This is particularly the case for contextual variation in the extent to which parliamentary voting behaviour follows the government–opposition divide. This article attempts to explain levels of government–opposition voting by looking at three factors: first, the majority status of cabinets (differentiating between majority and minority cabinets), cabinet ideology (differentiating between more centrist and more extremist cabinets) and norms about cabinet formation (differentiating between wholesale and partial alternation in government). The study includes variation at the level of the country, the government and the vote. The article examines voting in the Netherlands (with a history of partial alternation) and Sweden (with a history of wholesale alternation). We find strong support for the effect of cabinet majority status, cabinet ideology and norms about cabinet formation on government–opposition voting.","tags":null,"title":"Reaching across the aisle: Explaining government–opposition voting in parliament","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The policy link between voters and politicians has been a central issue in politics for quite some time.

The potential impact of these tools on election outcomes is substantial and hence it is important to study the effects of their design. This article focuses on the method used to calculate the match between voters and parties. More specifically, we examine the use (explicit or implicit) of alternative spatial models and metrics. The analyses are based on the actual answers given by users of one of the most popular VAAs in Europe, StemWijzer in the Netherlands. The results indicate that the advice depends strongly on the spatial model adopted. A majority of the users of StemWijzer would have received another advice, if another spatial model had been used. At the aggregate level this means that how often a particular party is presented as best match depends strongly on the method used to determine the advice. These findings have important implications for the design of future VAAs.","tags":null,"title":"The design effects of voting advice applications: Comparing methods of calculating matches","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Van Aelst","Tom Louwerse"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1399939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1399939200,"objectID":"4ede076812102d777e9907aa4de5c30d","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/publication/2014-vanaelst-louwerse-wep/","publishdate":"2014-05-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014-vanaelst-louwerse-wep/","section":"publication","summary":"Parliamentary systems are characterised by strong links between the executive and the legislature. While the importance of executive–legislative relationships is well-known, the extent to which executive dominance affects parliamentary behaviour is hard to grasp. This study uses the recent institutional crises in Belgium to study parliamentary behaviour in the absence of a government with full powers. Cabinet formation in Belgium has proved to be protracted in recent years, leading to long periods of government formation in both 2007–2008 and 2010–2011. Such circumstances provide a unique comparison between normal situations of parliament in the presence of government, and exceptional situations of prolonged periods of caretaker government. In particular the article looks at three aspects of parliamentary behaviour that are usually linked to executive–legislative relations: legislative initiatives, voting behaviour and party unity. The general hypothesis is that prolonged periods of government formation gave parliamentarians more opportunities to influence the legislative process and more (ideological) freedom. The results show a nuanced picture: parliament became more pro-active, the salience of the government–opposition divide declined, while party unity remained as strong as ever. It is concluded that government formation processes did not lead to drastic changes in the legislative–executive relationship, but rather permitted a modest correction to the extremely weak position of parliament.","tags":null,"title":"Parliament without Government: The Belgian Parliament and the Government Formation Processes of 2007–2011","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Fivaz","Tom Louwerse","Daniel Schwarz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1398902400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1398902400,"objectID":"97c17ecc54934c1c496b219b2d06a2a5","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/publication/2014-fivaz-etal-bc/","publishdate":"2014-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014-fivaz-etal-bc/","section":"publication","summary":"This study seeks to establish the effect of parliamentary specialisation on cosponsorship of parliamentary proposals in parliamentary systems with high levels of party unity.

De eurocrisis zet de verhouding tussen politiek en burgers onder druk. Wie naar de historische ontwikkeling van democratie in West- Europa en Amerika kijkt, zal zien dat sommige ontwikkelingen nieuw zijn, maar andere zich al eerder of elders hebben voorgedaan. Dit boek bespreekt de politiek van Groot-Brittannië, Frankrijk, Duitsland, Italië en de Verenigde Staten en trekt vergelijkende lessen. Dit boek biedt een toegankelijke inleiding tot de vergelijkende politiek voor zowel studenten als een breder publiek. Het helpt lezers hun eigen politieke argumenten te ontwikkelen en daarmee geïnformeerd en kritisch te zijn. De auteurs introduceren de concepten en analytische methoden die lezers nodig hebben om de complexiteit van de politieke wereld van vandaag te begrijpen, patronen te herkennen en landen met elkaar te vergelijken. In vijf landenhoofdstukken staan de geschiedenis, politieke scheidslijnen, politieke instituties, actoren en politieke partijen centraal. Nederland en België worden in deze vergelijkende context geplaatst: waarin zijn de Lage Landen bijzonder, op welk vlak zijn we eigenlijk maar heel gewoon?

We assess the convergent validity and scaling reliability of the low-dimensional models that are used to represent differences between parties and users. Convergent validity of the party positions in the EU Profiler is moderate to high, but scaling reliability is low for most of the issue dimensions included. We examine whether these problems are related to the EU Profiler's cross-national nature. The EU Profiler integrates the positions of parties from all over Europe into one pan-European model, even though students of European politics emphasise that there are structural differences between party competition in Central and Eastern Europe and Western Europe. We find that the EU Profiler performs better in terms of scaling reliability in Western European party systems than in Central and Eastern European party systems. In addition, there are substantive differences between individual countries.","tags":null,"title":"Design challenges in cross-national VAAs: the case of the EU Profiler","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom Louwerse"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1354320000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1354320000,"objectID":"7afab83a10669f8c2adb704fe62a2787","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/publication/2012-louwerse-rp/","publishdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012-louwerse-rp/","section":"publication","summary":"This article studies the extent to which Dutch political parties fulfil their electoral mandates.","tags":null,"title":"Het democratisch mandaat van Nederlandse politieke partijen: crisis of continuïteit?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom Louwerse"],"categories":null,"content":" Leven van Dick Dolman Tien jaar lang was Dick Dolman voorzitter van de Tweede Kamer (1979-1989). In Politiek samenspel kijkt hij terug op zijn privéleven en carrière aan de hand van de mensen die hij daarin ontmoette; in elk hoofdstuk staat één van hen centraal.\nDe lezer maakt allereerst in staccato kennis met (groot)ouders en familie- en studievrienden. Hoewel dit een aardig inzicht biedt in de ambities van de jonge Dolman, die op jonge leeftijd al op zomerkamp naar de VS gaat en zich later actief in het studentenleven mengt, wordt maar weinig duidelijk over zijn (politieke) keuzes. Waarom een studie economie en actief voor de PvdA? Het lijkt hem te overkomen. Wel is helder dat Dolman al vroeg de basis legde voor een partijpolitieke carrière, want veel van zijn latere PvdA-collega’s leert hij in deze periode al kennen.\nDe terugblik op zijn periode als Kamervoorzitter richt zich veelal op zijn representatieve taken. Over het werk in de Kamer valt maar weinig te lezen, met uitzondering van enkele van elders overgenomen toespraken en bijdragen. Zo wordt aan zijn eigen verkiezing als Kamervoorzitter slechts een enkele alinea besteed, terwijl het interessant zou zijn om te lezen hoe de gang van zaken destijds afwijkt van de open procedure waarin voorzitters sinds 2002 worden verkozen. Een inkijkje in de dagelijkse werkzaamheden van de voorzitter wordt geboden wanneer Dolman beschrijft dat hij soms alle fracties liet nabellen als nog niet de nodige 76 leden de presentielijst hadden getekend of als hij de uitbreiding van de personele ondersteuning van Kamerleden en de verbouwing van het Kamergebouw optekent.\nPolitiek samenspel is vooral een commentaar op gebeurtenissen in Dolmans carrière. Het biedt de lezer weinig context, waardoor het soms lastig te volgen zal zijn voor iemand die niet (meer) zo goed bekend is met de parlementaire geschiedenis van de jaren ’70 en ’80. Zelf vermeldt Dolman dat hij lang geen memoires wilde schrijven omdat hij in de politiek ‘geen echt belangrijke dingen’ zou hebben gedaan. Daarmee onderschat hij wellicht onbedoeld zijn rol als Kamervoorzitter. Dit boek smaakt naar meer, juist daarover.\n","date":1354320000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1354320000,"objectID":"f16c06f8205ce495e2d910f1a2a8cd68","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/publication/2012-louwerse-ob/","publishdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012-louwerse-ob/","section":"publication","summary":"Leven van Dick Dolman Tien jaar lang was Dick Dolman voorzitter van de Tweede Kamer (1979-1989).

This  study  provides an empirical analysis of a question many people feel they already have an answer to. The extent to which parties talk about similar issues and take similar positions before  and  after  elections  is  studied  in  the  context  of  the  United  Kingdom and the Netherlands. The main question is whether the different institutional structures in these countries lead to differences in  mandate fulfilment. To  answer  this  question,  this  book  provides  an  analysis  of  parties' election manifestos and parliamentary debates. It shows how the political competition changes  after  elections.  It  analyses  differences  between  government  and  opposition  and  the  impact  of  issue  saliency  and  policy  position  extremism.  Moreover, it provides an overview of mandate fulfilment since the 1950s: has party mandate fulfilment declined?","tags":null,"title":"Political parties and the democratic mandate.
