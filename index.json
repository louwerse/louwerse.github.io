Moving beyond the study of midterm election results, this is the first comparative study to assess the cyclical pulse of government party support in parliamentary democracies based on voting intention polls from 171 cycles in 22 countries. On average, government parties lose support during the first half of the electoral cycle, but at most partially recover from their initial losses. Under single-party government and when prime ministers control cabinet dissolution, support tends to follow the previously assumed u-shaped pattern more strongly. Finally, we find that government parties hardly recover from early losses since the 2000s.","tags":null,"title":"The electoral cycle effect in parliamentary democracies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"De Faculteit der Sociale Wetenschappen organiseert deze middag haar 1e alumni event met het thema de uitwisseling tussen wetenschap en praktijk.

We conceptualise opposition behaviour in terms of two independent dimensions: scrutiny (monitoring and criticising government actions) and policy-making (participating in or directly influencing legislative production). In line with the conceptualisation of populism as an opposition to the ruling elite in name of ‘the people’, our hypothesis is that populist opposition parties are more likely to use scrutiny and less likely to use policy-making tools than non-populist opposition parties. We study the Netherlands between 1998 and 2017 as a typical example of a consensus democracy, where populist parties have a greater opportunity to win representation and use parliamentary tools (compared to majoritarian democracies). Our findings indicate that populist opposition parties are particularly less likely to engage in policy-making behaviour and somewhat more likely to engage in scrutiny behaviour.","tags":null,"title":"How Populists Wage Opposition: Parliamentary Opposition Behaviour and Populism in Netherlands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Otjes","Tom Louwerse","Arco Timmermans"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1520553600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520553600,"objectID":"c1989aca5038442aa7dcf896f7324766","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/publication/2018-otjes-louwerse-timmermans/","publishdate":"2018-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-otjes-louwerse-timmermans/","section":"publication","summary":"We examine the development of opposition party behaviour in the Dutch Tweede Kamer between 1998 and 2015.

We find that consensus democracy is alive. During the economic crisis, the established rules of the game were reinvented to allow for productive cooperation between effectively a minority government and ‘constructive’ opposition parties.

We theorise that the use of parliamentary questions is related to the ideological and electoral competition between political parties, borrowing from theories on issue competition and negative campaigning. We provide an empirical test using data on written questions from the lower house in the Netherlands (1994-2014). Our analysis shows that parties tend to ask questions to ministers whose portfolios are salient to them, in line with issue ownership theories. Moreover they ask questions both to ministers from parties that are ideologically distant and those with whom they have considerable electoral overlap in line with studies of negative campaigning.

The confrontational approach is a flexible method of determining party policy positions, which is ideally suited to measure parties’ positions on issues that are specific to a country or period in time. We introduce a method of estimating the uncertainty of confrontational estimates by restating the approach as a special case of an item response theory, opening up the possibility of using the confrontational approach not only as a descriptive tool but also as a means of testing hypotheses on party policy preferences. We illustrate our model using analysis of the 2010 Dutch parliamentary election and the 2009 European elections.","tags":null,"title":"Estimating Uncertainty in Party Policy Positions Using the Confrontational Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom Louwerse","Simon Otjes","Cynthia van Vonno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"9dfc46b0eabe066f855a05ccef1c51cb","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/publication/2017-louwerse-otjes-vanvonno-actapolitica/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-louwerse-otjes-vanvonno-actapolitica/","section":"publication","summary":"This research note introduces the Dutch Parliamentary Behaviour Dataset, a record of parliamentary (voting) behaviour in the Dutch Tweede Kamer (Second Chamber, House of Representatives) since 1945.

This is particularly the case for contextual variation in the extent to which parliamentary voting behaviour follows the government–opposition divide.

The study includes variation at the level of the country, the government and the vote.

This article examines the effects of design choices on these tools by focusing on the response scale that is used to measure the policy positions of parties and voters. We analyze the impact of scale length on the advice generated by these tools using user data from a VAA developed for the 2014 Dutch local elections. We transform the original 101-point scale into several alternative scale formats and determine if this leads to a different voting recommendation. We also examine the suitability of alternative scales for creating spatial models, which are often employed by VAAs. We show that the response scale has a potentially profound impact on the resulting advice (with voters receiving different VAA outcomes depending on the scale length), except for voters with an extremist response style. The findings have practical implications for the design of these tools: outcomes should be presented as a preference list, rather than focusing on the “best match.”","tags":null,"title":"Response Scales in Voting Advice Applications: Do Different Designs Produce Different Outcomes?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477094400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477094400,"objectID":"c84c70678c13e5a1667b261e943d761b","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/talk/2016-10-22-dwars/","publishdate":"2016-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2016-10-22-dwars/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Campagne 2017: Kiesgedrag, peilingen \u0026 beloftes","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Tom Louwerse"],"categories":null,"content":" This is an open access publication   ","date":1470528000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1470528000,"objectID":"7a9ae6fe6a0631585eeced5a80892bd5","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/publication/2016-louwerse-ips/","publishdate":"2016-08-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016-louwerse-ips/","section":"publication","summary":"This article describes a statistical method for aggregating the information from Irish opinion polls.

The potential impact of these tools on election outcomes is substantial and hence it is important to study the effects of their design. This article focuses on the method used to calculate the match between voters and parties. More specifically, we examine the use (explicit or implicit) of alternative spatial models and metrics. The analyses are based on the actual answers given by users of one of the most popular VAAs in Europe, StemWijzer in the Netherlands. The results indicate that the advice depends strongly on the spatial model adopted. A majority of the users of StemWijzer would have received another advice, if another spatial model had been used. At the aggregate level this means that how often a particular party is presented as best match depends strongly on the method used to determine the advice.

While the importance of executive–legislative relationships is well-known, the extent to which executive dominance affects parliamentary behaviour is hard to grasp. This study uses the recent institutional crises in Belgium to study parliamentary behaviour in the absence of a government with full powers. Cabinet formation in Belgium has proved to be protracted in recent years, leading to long periods of government formation in both 2007–2008 and 2010–2011. Such circumstances provide a unique comparison between normal situations of parliament in the presence of government, and exceptional situations of prolonged periods of caretaker government. In particular the article looks at three aspects of parliamentary behaviour that are usually linked to executive–legislative relations: legislative initiatives, voting behaviour and party unity. The general hypothesis is that prolonged periods of government formation gave parliamentarians more opportunities to influence the legislative process and more (ideological) freedom. The results show a nuanced picture: parliament became more pro-active, the salience of the government–opposition divide declined, while party unity remained as strong as ever. It is concluded that government formation processes did not lead to drastic changes in the legislative–executive relationship, but rather permitted a modest correction to the extremely weak position of parliament.","tags":null,"title":"Parliament without Government: The Belgian Parliament and the Government Formation Processes of 2007–2011","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Fivaz","Tom Louwerse","Daniel Schwarz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1398902400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1398902400,"objectID":"4996a4780dd7236ba4510d094bb952d9","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/publication/2014-fivaz-etal-bc/","publishdate":"2014-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014-fivaz-etal-bc/","section":"publication","summary":"This study seeks to establish the effect of parliamentary specialisation on cosponsorship of parliamentary proposals in parliamentary systems with high levels of party unity.

De eurocrisis zet de verhouding tussen politiek en burgers onder druk. Wie naar de historische ontwikkeling van democratie in West- Europa en Amerika kijkt, zal zien dat sommige ontwikkelingen nieuw zijn, maar andere zich al eerder of elders hebben voorgedaan. Dit boek bespreekt de politiek van Groot-Brittannië, Frankrijk, Duitsland, Italië en de Verenigde Staten en trekt vergelijkende lessen. Dit boek biedt een toegankelijke inleiding tot de vergelijkende politiek voor zowel studenten als een breder publiek. Het helpt lezers hun eigen politieke argumenten te ontwikkelen en daarmee geïnformeerd en kritisch te zijn. De auteurs introduceren de concepten en analytische methoden die lezers nodig hebben om de complexiteit van de politieke wereld van vandaag te begrijpen, patronen te herkennen en landen met elkaar te vergelijken. In vijf landenhoofdstukken staan de geschiedenis, politieke scheidslijnen, politieke instituties, actoren en politieke partijen centraal. Nederland en België worden in deze vergelijkende context geplaatst: waarin zijn de Lage Landen bijzonder, op welk vlak zijn we eigenlijk maar heel gewoon? Het boek besluit met een blik op de toekomst: de recente politieke ontwikkelingen en trends zoals de (vermeende) legitimiteitscrisis, de eurocrisis, regionale afscheidingen, stedelijke protesten en de toekomst van de welvaartsstaat. Dit boek is bij uitstek geschikt voor gebruik in het universitair en hoger beroepsonderwijs. Het biedt didactische hulpmiddelen in de vorm van vragen, tijdlijnen, tekstvakken met aanvullende verdiepende informatie en overzichten van belangrijke concepten.","tags":null,"title":"Politiek in een veranderende wereld: Nederland en België in vergelijkend perspectief.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom Louwerse"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1364774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1364774400,"objectID":"9c2a066c161e43cf7fdcdd6b53ba7b27","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/publication/2013-louwerse-benm/","publishdate":"2013-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013-louwerse-benm/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Peilingen in het nieuws: van hypes naar trends","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom Louwerse","Simon Otjes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356825600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356825600,"objectID":"d552681f0a83505ce04ee1355646d9de","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/publication/2012-louwerse-otjes-ijeg/","publishdate":"2012-12-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012-louwerse-otjes-ijeg/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper analyses the design of the EU Profiler, the first truly cross-national VAA.

The central question is how collective mandate fulfilment has developed over the last sixty years. Increasing electoral volatility, changes in party organizations and the rise of populist parties could have resulted in a decrease of party mandate fulfilment. Contrary to previous studies, this article studies the mandate in terms of congruence between the electoral and parliamentary party competition. This allows for the study of opposition parties’ mandate fulfilment. Election manifestos and parliamentary debates are studied for six elections and the subsequent parliaments (between 1950-2006). The structure of the party competition is rather congruent before and after elections for all of the cases, except 1972-1977. There is no evidence for a decline of the degree to which parties collectively fulfil their electoral mandates.","tags":null,"title":"Het democratisch mandaat van Nederlandse politieke partijen: crisis of continuïteit?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom Louwerse"],"categories":null,"content":" Leven van Dick Dolman Tien jaar lang was Dick Dolman voorzitter van de Tweede Kamer (1979-1989). In Politiek samenspel kijkt hij terug op zijn privéleven en carrière aan de hand van de mensen die hij daarin ontmoette; in elk hoofdstuk staat één van hen centraal.\nDe lezer maakt allereerst in staccato kennis met (groot)ouders en familie- en studievrienden. Hoewel dit een aardig inzicht biedt in de ambities van de jonge Dolman, die op jonge leeftijd al op zomerkamp naar de VS gaat en zich later actief in het studentenleven mengt, wordt maar weinig duidelijk over zijn (politieke) keuzes. Waarom een studie economie en actief voor de PvdA? Het lijkt hem te overkomen. Wel is helder dat Dolman al vroeg de basis legde voor een partijpolitieke carrière, want veel van zijn latere PvdA-collega’s leert hij in deze periode al kennen.\nDe terugblik op zijn periode als Kamervoorzitter richt zich veelal op zijn representatieve taken. Over het werk in de Kamer valt maar weinig te lezen, met uitzondering van enkele van elders overgenomen toespraken en bijdragen. Zo wordt aan zijn eigen verkiezing als Kamervoorzitter slechts een enkele alinea besteed, terwijl het interessant zou zijn om te lezen hoe de gang van zaken destijds afwijkt van de open procedure waarin voorzitters sinds 2002 worden verkozen. Een inkijkje in de dagelijkse werkzaamheden van de voorzitter wordt geboden wanneer Dolman beschrijft dat hij soms alle fracties liet nabellen als nog niet de nodige 76 leden de presentielijst hadden getekend of als hij de uitbreiding van de personele ondersteuning van Kamerleden en de verbouwing van het Kamergebouw optekent.\nPolitiek samenspel is vooral een commentaar op gebeurtenissen in Dolmans carrière. Het biedt de lezer weinig context, waardoor het soms lastig te volgen zal zijn voor iemand die niet (meer) zo goed bekend is met de parlementaire geschiedenis van de jaren ’70 en ’80. Zelf vermeldt Dolman dat hij lang geen memoires wilde schrijven omdat hij in de politiek ‘geen echt belangrijke dingen’ zou hebben gedaan. Daarmee onderschat hij wellicht onbedoeld zijn rol als Kamervoorzitter. Dit boek smaakt naar meer, juist daarover.\n","date":1354320000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1354320000,"objectID":"b04fc48f973a4beb2b7a4a816d0e3dde","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/publication/2012-louwerse-ob/","publishdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012-louwerse-ob/","section":"publication","summary":"Leven van Dick Dolman Tien jaar lang was Dick Dolman voorzitter van de Tweede Kamer (1979-1989).

A central requirement of this model is that parties fulfil their electoral mandate. This article studies collective party mandate fulfilment by comparing parties’ election manifestos with the parliamentary speeches of their politicians in two countries: a typical consensus democracy, the Netherlands, and a typical majoritarian democracy, the United Kingdom. The central question is whether a difference in collective mandate fulfilment exists between these two types of democracy. Contrary to previous findings, this study finds that such a difference does not exist, at least not with regard to the two countries analysed. This can be explained by the way in which the party mandate is conceptualised. The article also analyses the development of party mandate fulfilment over time and finds no evidence for the idea that collective mandate fulfilment is declining.","tags":null,"title":"Mechanisms of Issue Congruence: The Democratic Party Mandate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom Louwerse"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1340323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1340323200,"objectID":"0f2e5efa2d2eabc0a461f965ed3b2bad","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/publication/2011-louwerse-thesis/","publishdate":"2012-06-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011-louwerse-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Do  political  parties  fulfil  their  election  mandates?  This  study  provides an empirical analysis of a question many people feel they already have an answer to. The extent to which parties talk about similar issues and take similar positions before  and  after  elections  is  studied  in  the  context  of  the  United  Kingdom and the Netherlands. The main question is whether the different institutional structures in these countries lead to differences in  mandate fulfilment. To  answer  this  question,  this  book  provides  an  analysis  of  parties' election manifestos and parliamentary debates. It shows how the political competition changes  after  elections.  It  analyses  differences  between  government  and  opposition  and  the  impact  of  issue  saliency  and  policy  position  extremism.

The party mandate model provides a system of linkage between citizen's preferences and parliamentary and governmental politics. Existing approaches to the party mandate focus on parties’ governmental mandate: do parties enact their pledges? Instead, the spatial approach looks at the representative aspect of the party mandate: how parties represent in parliament. This allows a more inclusive analysis of parties’ mandates as well as an evaluation of opposition parties’ records. The spatial approach is connected to Pitkin's idea that representation is an ‘institutionalised arrangement’. Thus, it focuses on the congruence of the electoral and parliamentary party competition rather than the record of individual parties. Analysis of recent elections and parliaments in the UK and the Netherlands reveals that the spatial approach offers the ability to analyse different political systems and can uncover differences between government and opposition and front- and backbenchers. Contrary to the findings of earlier studies, this study reveals that the party mandate model does not only apply to government parties and to Westminster style democracies.","tags":null,"title":"The Spatial Approach to the Party Mandate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Otjes","Tom Louwerse"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1285027200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1285027200,"objectID":"2893745551aa1e1064eadaaa7b187400","permalink":"https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/publication/2010-otjes-louwerse-helling/","publishdate":"2010-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010-otjes-louwerse-helling/","section":"publication","summary":"Het denken over democratisering binnen GroenLinks is blijven steken in het participatie-ideaal uit de jaren zeventig, hoewel dat niet meer klopt met de praktijk.
