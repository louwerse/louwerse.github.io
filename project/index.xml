      <description>The policy link between voters and politicians has been a central issue in politics for quite some time. My work focuses on the quality of this policy link: are representatives doing what people want?</description>

      <description>Opinion polls are an increasingly central part of election campaigns. My work focuses on the aggregation of opinion polls in Ireland and the Netherlands.
Peilingwijzer The Dutch public broadcaster NOS publishes my aggregation of Dutch national opinion polls, called &amp;lsquo;Peilingwijzer&amp;rsquo; (Polling Indicator).
Irish Polling Indicator My Irish Polling Indicator is published regularly on politicalreform.ie.</description>

      <title>Voting Advice Applications</title>

      <description>Voting Advice Applications have gained a large popular audience over the last decades, but their design has not been studied very elaborately. These tools ask voters for their opinion on a number of salient issues in an election and then present the ‘best match’ between the user’s preferences and the policy preferences of the political parties in a country. In a number of projects, together with different colleagues I have begun to unravel these issues of VAA design.</description>

      <title>Parliaments: rules and behaviour</title>

      <description>The digital publication of parliamentary data has provided a great incentive for the study of parliamentary behaviour. My current work focuses mainly on the Netherlands, but also Belgium and Sweden as well as country-comparative analysis.
The main questions that I focus on are those of patterns of parliamentary (voting) behaviour, particularly with regard to party unity and the government-opposition division in parliament. In addition, I am interested in the concept of (positive and negative) parliamentarism as well as the government formation process.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Political Representation in Times of Dealignment</title>
      <link>https://www.tomlouwerse.nl/project/napre/</link>

      <description>This project is collaborative work with Prof Thomas Zittel (Goethe Universität Frankfurt am Main) and Prof Rosie Campbell (King&amp;rsquo;s College London). It is financially supported by DFG, ESRC, and NWO under the Open Research Area (ORA). The project will start in Spring 2019.
  Weakening partisanship in West European electorates results in increasing disconnection between citizens and the state; raising pressing questions regarding future mechanisms of political representation that could sustain responsive government.</description>
